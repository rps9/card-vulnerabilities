Note that the source codes were modified for these tests 
in order to remove any sleeps or any while Loops that you may see
in the committed code in the project repo.

Also note that the results for dual_read/dual_write are the floor results
(as fast as I could do it -- any user's result would be slower than my best time 6.6s)
